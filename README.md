### ParkinSense

## Introduction
# Abstract
ParkinSense is an iPad application that uses machine learning to detect early signs of Parkinson's disease from voice recordings and hand-drawn inputs. This app identifies subtle changes in vocal and motor functions. Patients can spot potential symptoms early, and healthcare providers can track disease progression non-invasively. This tool aims to reduce reliance on the current subjective diagnosis approach and improve management of Parkinson's disease. In our endeavor to achieve this, we are also incorporating proposed functions, a UML diagram, an initial prototype, and a report detailing individual contributions to date.

# Executive Summary
Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting more than 1 million patients in the United States, trailing only Alzheimer's [1]. Forecasts suggest a rapid increase in the number, potentially doubling the global count of 7 million in 2020 by 2040 [2]. The financial strain is also significant, with the yearly costs of supporting a person with Parkinson's Disease (PPD) estimated to be $10,000 higher than individuals without, culminating in an annual expenditure of 23 billion US Dollars in the US [3]. Furthermore, many PPDs report psychological distress, diminished quality of life, and increased dependency on caregivers [4].
While there's currently no proven treatment [5], early diagnosis offers substantial benefits. It is highlighted by recent studies that early-stage PPDs who promptly undergo certain treatments can significantly reduce the worsening of symptoms like resting tremor [6]. Hence, detecting the disease at its early stages can be instrumental in slowing its progression, preserving the patient's quality of life, and mitigating socio-economic costs.
A distinct characteristic of Parkinson's disease is its influence on speech [7] and fine hand movements [8]. Individuals with Parkinson's often face motor-related challenges, exhibiting symptoms like monotone speech, dysarthria [9], and subtle inconsistencies in hand-drawn patterns due to muscle rigidity [10].
The traditional diagnostic method, Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), necessitates in-person visits and evaluations by healthcare professionals [11]. This method can be prone to errors from human interpretation [12] and poses a logistical challenge for many patients seeking medical attention. We are in a quest to make a non-intrusive software to capture both speech and handwriting data in routine settings. By utilizing machine learning, our solution aims to assist in identifying early signs of Parkinson's, offering both enhanced convenience for patients and a means for healthcare providers to manage the disease more efficiently.
